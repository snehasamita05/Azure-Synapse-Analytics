### 1. **Azure Synapse Analytics Overview**
   - Gained an understanding of **Azure Synapse Analytics**, an integrated analytics platform that combines big data and data warehousing capabilities.

### 2. **Azure Synapse SQL Pools**
   - Explored both **Dedicated SQL Pools** and **Serverless SQL Pools** for high-performance data storage and querying.

### 3. **Azure Synapse Architecture**
   - Learned about the **compute node** and **control node** architecture that underpins Azure Synapse Analytics.

### 4. **Azure Synapse Spark Pool**
   - Understand the role of **Azure Synapse Spark Pool** for big data processing and machine learning workflows.

### 5. **Azure Data Lake Integration**
   - Integrated **Azure Synapse Analytics** with **Azure Data Lake** to enable efficient data storage and analysis.

### 6. **Database Scoped Credentials and Managed Identity**
   - Managed **Database Scoped Credentials** and utilized **Managed Identity** for secure authentication to data sources and services.

### 7. **External Data Sources & CETAS**
   - Learned how to create **External Data Sources** and work with **CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS SELECT (CETAS)** in **Azure Synapse**.

### 8. **Polybase vs COPY INTO**
   - Compared the **Polybase** and **COPY INTO** methods for data ingestion in **Azure Synapse** and identified the best practices for data loading.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Dedicated SQL Pool and Serverless SQL Pool**
   - Worked with both **dedicated** and **serverless** SQL pools to optimize data processing and querying.

### 2. **Data Ingestion**
   - Ingested large datasets into **Azure Synapse** from **Azure Data Lake** and external sources.

### 3. **External Data Sources and CETAS**
   - Created **External Data Sources** and leveraged **CETAS (CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS SELECT)** to store external data in **Azure Synapse**.

### 4. **Openrowset for External Queries**
   - Utilized **Openrowset** to directly query external data stored in **Azure Data Lake** without importing it into Synapse.

### 5. **Polybase vs COPY INTO for Data Loading**
   - Compared and implemented **Polybase** and **COPY INTO** for efficient data loading into **Synapse SQL Pools**.

### 6. **Managed Identity for Secure Authentication**
   - Applied **Managed Identity** to securely authenticate and access **Azure Data Lake** and other services in **Azure Synapse**.

### 7. **Create Views and Manage Data**
   - Created and managed **views** and **external tables** to enhance the structure of data in **Azure Synapse**.
